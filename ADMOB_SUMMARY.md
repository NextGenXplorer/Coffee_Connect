## Testing Status

### ⏳ Pending Testing
The implementation is complete but requires a **native build** to test (Expo Go doesn't support AdMob).

### How to Test
1. **Build the app**: `eas build --profile development --platform android`
2. **Install on device**: Download and install APK
3. **Test banner ads**: Navigate through all screens
4. **Test interstitial ads**: Switch between tabs multiple times
5. **Check logs**: Verify ads are loading and showing

See **BUILD_AND_TEST_ADMOB.md** for detailed testing instructions.

## Current Configuration

### Test Mode Settings
```javascript
// AdMob App ID (in app.config.js)
android_app_id: "ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713" // Google Test ID

// Banner Ad Unit ID (in AdBanner.tsx)
TestIds.ADAPTIVE_BANNER // Google Test ID

// Interstitial Ad Unit ID (in useInterstitialAd.ts)
TestIds.INTERSTITIAL // Google Test ID

// Interstitial Frequency (in App.tsx)
30% of tab changes // Configurable
```

## Production Deployment Checklist

- **BUILD_AND_TEST_ADMOB.md** - Step-by-step testing instructions
- **ADMOB_SUMMARY.md** - This quick reference (you are here)

### Code Documentation
- All ad components have inline comments
- Test vs production ID switching explained
- Configuration options documented

## Revenue Potential

### Estimated Earnings (Example)
Based on typical AdMob rates for similar apps:

**Assumptions:**
- 1,000 daily active users
- 10 ad impressions per user per day
- $1 CPM (cost per 1000 impressions) average

**Calculation:**
- Daily: 1,000 users × 10 impressions = 10,000 impressions
- Daily revenue: 10,000 / 1,000 × $1 = **$10/day**
- Monthly revenue: $10 × 30 = **$300/month**

**Note:** Actual revenue varies based on:
- User location (US/EU higher CPM)
- Ad type and placement
- User engagement
- Advertiser demand

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Testing)
1. ✅ Implementation complete
2. ⏳ Build app with `eas build`
3. ⏳ Install and test on device
4. ⏳ Verify both banner and interstitial ads work
5. ⏳ Check console logs for successful loading

### Short Term (Production)
1. Create AdMob account
2. Register app and create ad units
3. Update code with production IDs
4. Test with production ads
5. Submit to Play Store

### Long Term (Optimization)
1. Monitor AdMob performance
2. Adjust interstitial frequency based on user retention
