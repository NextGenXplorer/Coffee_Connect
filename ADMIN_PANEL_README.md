## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Admin Account Security

This application loads admin credentials from environment variables. For security reasons, **default passwords are not provided**. You must create your own secure credentials by following the steps below.

### How to Configure Admin Credentials

1.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory of the project. This file is ignored by Git, so your credentials will not be committed to the repository.

2.  **Add your admin credentials** to the `.env` file in the following format. You can define up to 10 admin accounts.

    ```bash
    # .env

    # Super Admin (has access to all markets)
    EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_USERNAME_1="super_admin"
    EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD_1="YOUR_VERY_SECURE_PASSWORD_HERE"
    EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ROLE_1="super_admin"
    EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_MARKET_1="all"

    # Market Admin for Ramanagara
    EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_USERNAME_2="admin_ramanagara"
    EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD_2="ANOTHER_SECURE_PASSWORD"
    EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ROLE_2="market_admin"
    EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_MARKET_2="Ramanagara"

    # Market Admin for Kollegala
    EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_USERNAME_3="admin_kollegala"
    EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD_3="YET_ANOTHER_SECURE_PASSWORD"
    EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_ROLE_3="market_admin"
    EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_MARKET_3="Kollegala"

    # Add more admins as needed...
    ```

3.  **Use Strong Passwords**: It is critical to use strong, unique passwords for each admin account to protect the integrity of the market data.

4.  **Restart Your Application**: After creating or modifying the `.env` file, you must restart the Expo development server for the changes to take effect. You can do this by stopping the current server (`Ctrl+C`) and running `expo start -c`.
